It contains a series of questions that you must answer by adding code cells and, if needed, markdown explanations. The exercises should feel manageable if you have the expected background. If you find them too difficult, we advise against enrolling in this course, as it requires a somehow solid understanding of Python and scientific libraries. However, if you’re unsure and would like to discuss your level and options, feel free to reach out to the teaching team—we’re happy to help. This session also introduces key resources that can assist you in solving problems throughout the course.  \n",
